## Project Directory Structure

This repository contains the HDL design and simulation files for a **Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS)** system to be implemented on the **Nexys A7 FPGA**.

---

### 'Memory_Files/`

Contains all `.mem` files used to preload memory with waveform or LUT data.

- Initialises waveform samples (e.g., sine, square, triangle and sawtooth)

These are essential for both behavioural simulation and hardware synthesis using BRAM.

---

### 'Modules/`

Includes reusable **Verilog modules** that act as building blocks for the DDS system.
Each module performs a defined function and can be independently simulated or integrated into a top-level design.

---

### `Top_Modules/`

Holds **top-level Verilog files** that integrate all components into a working system.

- Connects waveform generators with I/O (switches, LEDs, 7-segment display)
- Manages high-level control logic and signal routing
- Provides a complete design ready for synthesis and FPGA programming
- Includes the **top-level testbench** for simulation
Each top-level module represents a complete functional version of the DDS system.
