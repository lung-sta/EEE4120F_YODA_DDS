This directory contains the following memory initialisation files:
1. sawtooth_lut_values.mem: Contains 1024 pre-calculated 16-bit signed integer values representing one complete cycle of a sawtooth waveform. This file is used to initialise the sawtooth_lookup.v ROM module.
2. sine_lut_values.mem: Contains 1024 pre-calculated 16-bit signed integer values representing one complete cycle of a sine waveform. This file is used to initialise the sine_lookup.v ROM module.
3. square_lut_values.mem: Contains 1024 pre-calculated 16-bit signed integer values representing one complete cycle of a square waveform. This file is used to initialise the squares_lookup.v ROM module.
4. triangle_lut_values.mem: Contains 1024 pre-calculated 16-bit signed integer values representing one complete cycle of a triangle waveform. This file is used to initialise the triangles_lookup.v ROM module.
These .mem files are generated by MATLAB to populate the Read Only Memory (ROM) modules in the Verilog design, allowing the DDS system to efficiently retrieve waveform amplitude values based on the phase accumulator's output.
